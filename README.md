# ProgMob
Shared repo for two school projects on mobile app development

One project is an android app to control a connected house with multiple sensors arranged in a list of rooms. 
Developped in java, the goal of the project was to discover the basics of UI elements and how to interact with a RESTful API.

The second project is a ToDo app in Swift, less advanced that the first project, fewer time was allocated to it.
Its goal was to understand the differences between the two programming languages and to grasp the unique features of Swift.

These two app were made with education in mind and some of the feature may not be implemented the best way.
Choices made during development (e.g listView instead of recyclerView) reflect this educational purpose,
they allowed a better display of the technicalities of the language used.

A lot of improvements could still be made on those apps, but they weren't deemed necessary,
as the goal of the project was more to learn than to make a fully-functionning app.
